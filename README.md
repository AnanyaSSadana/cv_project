Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the performance of self-supervised learning models in histopathology by incorporating synthetic images alongside real images. The models evaluated in this study are SimCLR and StableRep, both utilizing the Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) encoder. The study demonstrates that using synthetic data in conjunction with real data significantly improves the models' ability to learn robust and generalizable representations, ultimately leading to better performance in histopathological image classification.
